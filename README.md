RESTful Endpoints: Well-defined APIs to handle employee data efficiently.
Data Persistence: Integrated with a relational database (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) for storing employee records.
Exception Handling: Custom exception handling for robust error management.
Validation: Data validation to ensure the integrity of employee information.
Service Layer: Decoupled business logic for maintainability and scalability.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL (JPA/Hibernate)
REST API: JSON format for request/response handling
Tools: Maven/Gradle, Postman (for API testing)
